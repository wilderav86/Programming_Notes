        <strong>Styling</strong>
    </H2>
    
    <p>You can use <Strong>inline styling</Strong> to change the look of elements.</p>
    
    <p style="color:blue";>
        For instance, if i wanted to make everything in this < p > tag blue, I would add the inline tag: style="color: blue"; inside the opening <em>P tag</em>.
        This method can be repititious and is prone to errors.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You can add as many style attributes as you want as long as they are divided by a semicolon and inside the quotation marks.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <em>Example:</em> <mark>style="color: blue; text-align: center";</mark>
    </p>
    
    
    
    <p>
        A more efficient way of styling is using <strong>Style elements</strong>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Style elements</strong> are used with <em><mark>selectors</mark></em> to style multiple elements at a time. 
        <br><br>
        
        For instance, if you want to style all h2 elements with the same font you would create an opening and closing "style " tag that contains <em>"h2 {font-style:"comic sans"}"</em>
    </p>
    
    
    
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="selectors">
    
        <h2>
            <strong>Selectors</strong>
        </h2>
        
    
        <p>
            <strong>Class selectors</strong> work the same way style elements use selectors to style multiple elements at a time.
             Say you want to change the color of everything contained in a single < p > tag, while leaving other < p > tags alone. You can insert <em><mark>class="class_name"</mark></em>
             into the < p > tag, then create a < style > tag containing <mark>".class_selector { color:'red'}"</mark>
        </p>
    
        <p>
            <strong>id selectors</strong> work in the same way, but only when a single element needs styling. instead of a "." to reference an id selector, it uses a "#"
        </p>
    
        <p>
            You can also combine selectors by using <strong>descendant selectors</strong>. For instance, if you want to style all < em > tags within an < li > tag, you would use <em><mark>li em {color: red;}</mark></em>
        </p>

        <p>

    </div>
