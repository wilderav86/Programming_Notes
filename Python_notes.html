            <ol>
                <li><span><strong>Program</strong></span>: A set of instructions for the computer to follow</li>
            
                <li><span><strong>Variable</strong></span>: A connection between a name in the code and some data in the computer"s memory.</li>

                        <li>An example of a variable is: <mark>fred = turtle.Turtle()</mark>. </li>

                <li><span><strong>Turtle</strong></span>: A <em>data object</em> that knows how to draw lines on the screen.</li>

                The term string comes from the idea that these bits of code are strings (that is, sequences) of charactersâ€”in other words, we would say that a piece of code like <em>"green"</em> is a string of characters. <mark>strings must be enclosed in quotation marks or python will not recognize them.</mark>
            </li>
            <li><span><strong>Integer</strong></span>: A whole number with no fraction or decimal part.</li>
            <li><span><strong>Module</strong></span>: A file that has a collection of useful code that can be used in other Python programs.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Modules must be imported. For instance, if we wanted to import a math module we would use the line: <mark>import math</mark>.</li>
                </ul>
            <li><span><strong>Comment</strong></span>: You can write a comment in your code by using the # symbol. comments will not be recognized by the program as code. ex. <em># this is a comment.</em></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can use comments to temporarily turn off a line of code so it doesn't run.</li>
                </ul>

        <h1><strong>Python Part 2</strong></h1>
        <div>
            <h2><strong>The Input Fuction</strong></h2>

            <p>
                <mark> input</mark> and <mark> print</mark> are examples of what we would call <em>built-in</em> functions-- funtions that are built into python.
                In other words, these functions come with python when you install it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <mark>Input</mark> allows the program to receive input from the user and do something with that response.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>This code will ask the user their name then print it with "greetings"
                    <br>
                    <em>name = input("whats your name?)</em>
                    <br>
                    <em>print("greetings")</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                
            </p>



        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><strong>The int function</strong></h2>

            <p>
                This takes the string returned by the input function, and passes it to the int function. The int function takes that string and converts it to an integer.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <P>
                example:
                <br>
                <mark>n = int(input("Please enter a number:"))
                <br>
                Please enter a number: 4
                <br>
                n + 2
                </mark>
                <br><br>
                This will turn the value that we stored in "n" into an integer. If the "int" function was not used, "n" would be recognized as a string and throw an error.
            </P>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2><strong> The Len Function</strong></h2>

            <p>
                The len function counts the number of characters in a string.
                <br><br>
                example:
                <br>
                <mark>word = "python"
                <br>
                len(word)
                </mark>
                <br>This line of code will give you the integer "6" because there are 6 characters in the word "python"
            </p>
            <p>
                The len funtcion can also count the number of items in a string.
                <br><br>
                example:
                <br>
                <mark>len([3, 4, 5])</mark>  
                <br>
                This will give you the integer "3", since there are 3 items in the list.

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="while_loops">
            <h2><strong>While Loops</strong></h2>
            <p>
                A <em>while loop</em> will continue to run while some condition is true. As soon as the condition is false, the loop will stop.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    n = 1
                    <br>
                    while n < 3:
                    <br>
                    ___print(n)
                    <br>
                    ___n += 1
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Before the loop, we set 'n' to a starting number: <em>n = 1</em>
                <br><br>
                Then we check is 'n' is less than 3: <em>while n < 3:</em>
                <br><br>
                The current value if 'n' is 1, so this means that 'n < 3' evaluates to True.
                <br>
                so the code inside the while loop will run.
                <br><br>
                Inside the loop, we first print the value of 'n', and then we increase 'n' by 1: <em>n += 1</em>
                <br><br>
                Then, we go back to the top of the loop and do the while thing over again. And we keep repeating this process until the value of 'n' gets large enough that 'n < 3' evaluates to False--at which point the loop stops running.
            </p>
